LET
Highlights
Syntax:
    - Variables
    - zero?(e)
    - if e1 then e2 else e3
    - let id=e1 in e2

Semantics
- The notion of environment
- The presence of variables in the syntax and the
corresponding notion of environment in the semantics
- Booleans.

PROC
- Syntax
    + proc (x) {x+1}    Function declaration
    + (f 2)             Application

Semantics
    - What is the value of proc (x) {x + 1} ??
    let f = proc (x) { x + 1 }
    in (f 2) + (f 3)
    => returns 7

    The value of a function is a closure. A closure is a triple
    that consists of (id, e, env)

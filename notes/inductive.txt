A means of defining sets that
1. Describes how to generate its elements 
    => Derivation
2. Comes equpped with a technique for proving properties of its elements 
    => Structural Induction
3. Comes equipped with a technique for defining functions over its elements 
    => Structural Recursion

All inductive definitions require specficying two elements
1. A universe
    => In programming language the universe is typically specified by giving an alphabet
    and then taking the universe to be the set of all words from that alphabet
2. The smallest subset of the universe that satisfies certain conditions

example:
Sigma = { ( , ) , s , z } <= called an alphabet
Universe = Sigma^* <= all the words over the alphabet

S = {z, s(z), s(s(z)), ...}
    U
    {s, s(s), s(s(s)), ...}


<S> ::= z       S generates z
<S> ::= s(<S>)      Parser

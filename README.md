## CS496 - Principals of Progamming Langauges [S22]
A recollection of various homework assignments / lecture notes / projects from CS496 taught at Stevens Institute of Technology under professor Eduardo Bonelli.

Given a lexer, parser, and the fundamentals of the OCaml programming language, we were tasked to create our own programming langauge, PLaF, from scratch.
The full PLaF codebase can be found within this repository: https://github.com/ebonelli/PLaF.
